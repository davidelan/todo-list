 *TO-DO list Creator* is a website that lets you create a TO-DO list with a list of tasks. The user can create multiple tasks and give names to each one of them. The user can, for example, have a food shopping TO-DO list with items to by at the supermarket.
 The user can create an account, login in, modify and delete the TO-DO list's items. 
 It is a full-stack Django project running on Heroku.
